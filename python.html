          <h1>A Short History of Python - Taylors Version</h1>  
          <p>Tour though the Python Eras </p>

            <div class="taylor taylor1">
                <h2>Early Years</h2>
                    <p>In the early years, Python was just a shy and unassuming language, like a talented high school student new to the coding scene.</p>
                    <p>With clean syntax and simplicity, Python was a blank space that would write your name.</p>
                    <p>It was the innocent beginning of a beautiful love story.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="taylor taylor2">
                <h2> Evolution (Python 2.0) </h2>
                    <p>Like the "Fearless" era, Python had its moment with Python 2.0. It was like finding the perfect melody, new features made developers swoon, like list comprehensions. Python was no longer a country song; it was ready to rock the programming world.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="taylor taylor3">
                <h2> Breakup (Python 3.0)</h2>
                    <p>Like a breakup anthems, Python 2 was replaced with Python  Python 3, which was a shake it off with backward-incompatible changes. It was a heartbreak for some developers, but Python was determined to grow, don't say I didn't warn you.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="taylor taylor4">
                <h2> Rise to Stardom (Python in Web Development)</h2>
                    <p>Python found its love in web development, just as Taylor's albums started topping charts. Frameworks like Django and Flask made web development with Python "Picture to Burn" for developers - quick and fiery.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="taylor taylor5">
                <H2>1989: Python in Data Science and Machine Learning<H2>

                    <p>Python's "1989" era was its transition to data science and machine learning. Libraries like NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn turned Python into a superstar in the world of data analysis. Python became the "Shake It Off" anthem for data scientists.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="taylor taylor6">
                <H2>Reputation: Python Dominance (Present)</H2>

                    <P>Python's reputation soared to new heights in the 2010s. It became the go-to language for AI and machine learning with TensorFlow and PyTorch. Just like Taylor's "Reputation" era, Python was at the top of its game, dominating the charts - or rather, the code.</P>
            </div>

            <div class="taylor taylor7">
                <H2>Evermore</H2>
                    <p> continues to captivate programmers worldwide, and its story is far from over. Like Taylor Swift, Python's journey has been filled with ups and downs, but its catchy syntax and versatility have made it a pop culture icon in the programming world. As Taylor would say, "Python, you belong with me. Karma is a Queen. "</p>
