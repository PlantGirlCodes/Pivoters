          <h1>A Short History of Python - Taylors Version</h1>  
          <p>subtile : cruel summer </p>

                <h2>Early Years</h2>
                    <p>In the early years, Python was just a shy and unassuming language, much like Taylor Swift when she first entered the music scene.</p>
                    <p>With its clean syntax and simplicity, Python was a blank space waiting to be filled with code.</p>
                    <p>It was the innocent beginning of a beautiful love story.</p>
            </div>
            <!-- comments for info on baxes -->
            <div class="taylor">
                <h2> Evolution (Python 2.0) </h2>
                    <p>Like Taylor Swift's "Fearless" era, Python had its moment of evolution with Python 2.0. It was like finding the perfect melody, introducing features that made developers swoon, like list comprehensions and Unicode support. Python was no longer a country song; it was ready to rock the programming world.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="taylor">
                <h2> Breakup (Python 3.0)</h2>
                    <p>Much like Taylor's breakup anthems, Python introduced Python 3.0, which shook things up with backward-incompatible changes. It was a heartbreak for some developers, but Python was determined to grow, just like Taylor after a breakup.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="taylor">
                <h2> Rise to Stardom (Python in Web Development)</h2>
                    <P>Python found its love in web development, just as Taylor Swift's albums started topping charts. Frameworks like Django and Flask made web development with Python "Picture to Burn" for developers - quick and fiery.</P>
            </div>
            <div class="taylor">
                <H2>1989: Python in Data Science and Machine Learning<H2>

                    <p>Python's "1989" era was its transition to data science and machine learning. Libraries like NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn turned Python into a superstar in the world of data analysis. Python became the "Shake It Off" anthem for data scientists.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="taylor">
                <H2>Reputation: Python Dominance (Present)</H2>

                    <P>Python's reputation soared to new heights in the 2010s. It became the go-to language for AI and machine learning with TensorFlow and PyTorch. Just like Taylor's "Reputation" era, Python was at the top of its game, dominating the charts - or rather, the code.</P>
            </div>
            <div class="taylor">
                <H2>Evermore</H2>
                    <p> continues to captivate programmers worldwide, and its story is far from over. Like Taylor Swift, Python's journey has been filled with ups and downs, but its catchy syntax and versatility have made it a pop culture icon in the programming world. As Taylor would say, "Python, you belong with me."</p>
