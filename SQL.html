        <h1>SQL</h1>
        <p>SQL (or Structured Query Language) was first developed in the early 1970s by Donald D. Chamberlin and Raymond F. Boyce at IBM. It emerged as a standardized way to manage and manipulate data stored in relational database management systems (RDBMS), paving the way for efficient data management and retrieval in a structured manner.</p>
        <p>Because SQL is the language of databases, it offers a powerful way to interact with and manage data. This means it's not just a skill; it's a gateway to the world of data-driven decision-making and tech opportunities. Let's explore why SQL is a valuable tool for anyone looking to pivot their career to the tech industry.</p>
