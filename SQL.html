        <h1>Structured Query Language</h1>
        <p>SQL, or Structured Query Language, was developed by IBM in the 1970s as a standardized language for interacting with relational databases. SQL quickly gained popularity and became the industry standard for database management systems. Over the years, various versions and dialects of SQL have emerged, with MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server being some of the most prominent implementations. SQL's flexibility and power have made it an integral part of data management and analysis in diverse fields, from finance and healthcare to e-commerce and social media.</p>
