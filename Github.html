            <h1>What Is GitHub? (And What Is It Used For?)</h1>
            <P>GitHub is an online software development platform. It's used for storing, tracking, and collaborating on software projects. It makes it easy for developers to share code files and collaborate with fellow developers on open-source projects. GitHub also serves as a social networking site where developers can openly network, collaborate, and pitch their work.</P>

        <H2>How does GitHub work?</H2>
        <p>GitHub users create accounts, upload files, and create coding projects. But the real work of GitHub happens when users begin to collaborate.
        While anyone can code independently, teams of people build most development projects. Sometimes these teams are all in one place at once time, but more often they work asynchronously. There are many challenges to creating collaborative projects with distributed teams. GitHub makes this process much simpler in a few different ways.
        First, all the code and documentation are in one place. This limits issues with access for anyone who wants to contribute to a project. Each repository also contains instructions and other details to help outline project goals and rules.
        Next, coding is more creative and abstract than most non-technical people think it is. For example, say two devs are working on different pieces of code. These two pieces of code should work together. But sometimes one piece of code can make the other code fail. Or a piece of code can have an unexpected impact on how the other code works.
        GitHub solves these problems by showing how both files will change the main branch. It catches these errors before pushing changes, making the coding process more efficient.     
        GitHub also makes it easier to track changes and go back to previous versions of a project. To explain this, we’ll need to understand the technology that GitHub is based on, Git, and talk about version control.</p>

        <h2>What is GitHub used for?</h2>

        <P>
            GitHub allows software developers and engineers to create remote, public-facing repositories on the cloud for free. A repository, or "repo" for short, is a coding project’s files and the revision history for each file.
            Once you’ve set up a repository on GitHub, you can copy it to your device, add and modify files locally, then "push" your changes back to the repository where your changes display for the public.
            So, why would you prefer GitHub over developing with a private repository? Here are the key reasons why GitHub is such a big player:</P>

            <h3>Enhanced Collaboration</h3>
        <p>
            The selling point of GitHub is its set of project collaboration features, including version control and access control.To illustrate what’s possible with GitHub, imagine this scenario. You want to code an online game, and you enlist your friend to help you.You create a repository on GitHub that stores all the files, including current and past versions, then give your friend collaborator access to this repo as well." https://blog.hubspot.com/website/what-is-github-used-for#what-github

        <h3>Benefits of Github</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>It makes it easy to contribute to your open-source projects</li>
            Nearly every open-source project uses GitHub to manage its project. Using GitHub is free if your project is open source and includes a wiki and issue tracker that makes it easy to include more in-depth documentation and get feedback about your project. If you want to contribute, you just fork a project, make your changes and then send them a pull request using the GitHub web interface.</p>
            <li>Documentation</li>
            By using GitHub, you make it easier to get excellent documentation.
            <li>Showcase your work</li>
            Are you a developer and wish to attract recruiters? GitHub is the best tool you can rely on for this. Today, when searching for new recruits for their project, most companies look into GitHub profiles. If your profile is available, you will have a higher chance of being recruited even if you are not from a great university or college.
            <li>Track changes in your code across versions</li>
            When multiple people collaborate on a project, it’s hard to keep track of revisions—who changed what, when, and where those files are stored. GitHub takes care of this problem by keeping track of all the changes that have been pushed to the repository. Much like using Microsoft Word or Google Drive, you can have a version history of your code so that previous versions are not lost with every iteration.
